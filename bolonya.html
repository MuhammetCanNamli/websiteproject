            <div class="yazi3"><p id="text">
                <br/>Nicknamed the "Red City", Bologna makes its guests feel the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. In the city, which is located in the north of Italy, you can come across a structure dating back centuries at every step.<br/><br/>
                For this reason, it is necessary to be selective, taking into account the limited vacation time, while preparing the itinerary.<br/>
            </p></div>

            <div class="yazi3"><p id="text">
                <br/><b>Historic Center (Maggiore Square and Surroundings)</b><br/>
                The historic center of Bologna, or Centro Storico, as it is known in the local language, stands out as the most ideal accommodation for travelers planning their first trip to the city.<br/><br/>
                If you intend to be in the action during your holiday, stay within walking distance of places to visit, and make frequent use of the prestigious shopping and eating and drinking opportunities of the city,<br/>
                In your search for where to stay in Bologna, you can focus on the Maggiore Square, which is the heart of the Old Town, and the hotels around it.<br/><br/>
                When preparing a list of places to visit for Piazza Maggiore and its surroundings, you can write the Basilica of San Petronio, which has not been completed since the 16th century for various reasons.<br/><br/>
                In addition to the basilica, which draws attention with its eye-catching architectural details, the Bologna City Hall that adorns the square deserves to be visited.<br/>
                While spending time in the square, you can also come across one of the frequently set up markets and understand more easily why Bologna is called the capital of Italy in terms of gastronomic terms.<br/>
                Afterwards, you can take your breath away at the stores on Via dell' Indepenza in order to evaluate the beautiful shopping opportunities.<br/><br/>
                Centro Storico, the most striking area of Bologna both architecturally and culturally, occupies a very small area.<br/>
                Thus, travelers can easily tour the entire region on foot. Naturally, staying in the heart of the city means almost zero transportation costs in the city.<br/><br/>
                Before deciding to stay in Maggiore Square and its surroundings, it is necessary to consider the disadvantages as well as the advantages. Because of the intense interest, the overnight accommodation prices here are slightly higher than in other parts of the city.<br/><br/>
                The area around the square is also known for its crowded atmosphere. However, when you prefer hotels in the parts of the center that are a little further out, you can find affordable accommodation in a relatively secluded environment.<br/><br/><br/>
                <u><i> The most popular hotels in this area are: </i></u><br/><br/>
                3★ Hotel Cavour: Booking.com score 8.7.

                4★ Best Western Hotel San Donato: Booking.com score 8.3. The hotel, which is 10 kilometers from the airport, serves in the university district of Bologna.

                <br/><b>Fiere District (Fiere di Bologna)</b><br/>
                If you intend to stay in an area where you will not be affected by the crowd of the city center, "Where to stay in Bologna?" You can search for the answer to the question within the boundaries of the Fiere Region.<br/><br/>
                The area takes its name from the Bologna Fairground, namely Fiere di Bologna. As a result, the area surrounding the fair complex has made a name for itself as the most important commercial area of the city. Fiere Region hotels aim to satisfy their guests with their functional designs and economical prices in line with this situation.<br/><br/>
                The distance between Fiere District and Centro Storico is 3-4 kilometers. Therefore, before you leave your hotel and spend some of your time on transportation to the heart of the city, you can enjoy the facilities of FICO Italy World, the largest food park in the world.<br/><br/>
                In the park, where you will have the opportunity to clearly observe why Italy is one of the most important countries in the world in terms of gastronomic terms and the richness of its culinary culture, you can learn the tricks of the production of delicacies from the masters.<br/><br/>
                If you are hungry, you can head to the food stalls or restaurants in the facility. This place is also ideal for acquiring the best quality kitchen materials you can find in the city.<br/><br/>
                Even if you do not plan to attend the organized commercial events, you can choose to stay in the Fiere Region as the nightly room rates are much more affordable than the city center. Moreover, as I mentioned at the beginning of the commercial life of Bologna, you can enjoy the calm environment without being affected by the busy atmosphere and noise.<br/><br/>
                Do not be deceived by the distance, and do not think that staying in the Fiere Region will cause you problems in terms of time and transportation. Because, due to commercial activities and large-scale organizations, a very good public transportation network has been established between this part of the city and the center.<br/><br/>
                If you wish, you can use this net or you can choose to walk by breathing the medieval air intensifying towards Maggiore Square.<br/>

                3★ Hotel Michelino Bologna Fiera: Booking.com score 8.7. The boutique hotel, which pleases its guests with the positive approach and hygiene level of its staff, serves 200 meters from the fairground. <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/hotel-michelino-bologna-fiera.tr.html?aid=366502;label=Bologna_konaklama_Michelino" target="_blank">Click</a> for detailed information and reservation.<br/><br/>

                <br/><b>Around the Train Station</b><br/>
                Bologna Central Train Station is just north of Centro Storico. The hotels around the train station, which is about a 20-minute walk from Piazza Maggiore, which is the social and cultural center of the city, have become popular thanks to their affordable prices.<br/><br/>
                Moreover, if your holiday is not limited to two or three days, you can take daily excursions to the dazzling cities of Northern Italy by trains departing from here.<br/><br/>
                For travelers staying in hotels around the train station, the Asinelli and Garisenda Towers and Bologna Cathedral are among the places to be included in the daily visit program.<br/><br/>
                Depending on the activities you plan to do in the city, you can expand your list of places to visit to include landmarks such as the Neptune Fountain, the Basilica of San Petronio and the Archaeological Museum.<br/><br/>
                In fact, when you want to experience the lively nightlife, you can go to the university district, which is close to the city center. Entertainment venues attracting great interest from university students, which add color to daily life in Bologna, are mainly located on Via Zamboni.<br/><br/>
                Bologna Centrale, one of the busiest stations in Italy, has a direct connection with high-speed train lines. In this way, travelers focus on visiting Florence, Milan, Rome, Venice and Rimini in their remaining time after visiting the attractions in the heart of the city.<br/><br/>
                You can also take your place on the bus services from the terminal right next to the station in order to discover the hidden cultural treasures of Northern Italy.<br/><br/>
                The train station surroundings, one of the most popular accommodation areas in the city, offer travelers on a budget exactly what they are looking for. Moreover, unlike many European cities, the hotels here display a similar profile in terms of quality as most of their counterparts in the city centre.<br/><br/>
                In addition to all these advantages, its proximity to the university district and the historical center also makes the hotels around the train station attract great attention.<br/><br/>

                <br/><b>Asinelli and Garisenda Towers (Two Towers)</b><br/>
                If you want to start the first day of your holiday by watching the magnificent view of the city center, which seems untouched for centuries, you can write the Asinelli and Garisenda Towers at the top of your list of places to visit in Bologna.<br/><br/>
                The towers, which are the main symbols of the city, were built by the Asinelli Family between 1109-1119. It is believed that these mighty structures, numbering 180 at that time, were built both to emphasize the power of families and to provide security.<br/><br/>
                The Asinelli and Garisenda Towers owe their reputation mainly to their tilt. Already, the guides use the definition of the world's tallest and leaning medieval structure for the 97.2-meter-high Asinelli when promoting these towers.<br/><br/>
                This situation can be observed much more easily in its 47-meter twin, Garisenda.<br/><br/>

                After you climb to the top of the towers and watch the view, you can turn your route towards Piazza Maggiore, which is considered the heart of the city. Although, you can be sure that you will reach this square somehow, no matter which street you follow while wandering around the area.<br/><br/>
                Especially if you go to the square in the summer, you can encounter a much more fun atmosphere than the rest of the year. You can even enjoy watching movies outdoors between 18 June and 15 August.<br/><br/>
                The 13th-century Piazza Maggiore becomes the center of attention thanks to the historical buildings around it. Basilica di San Petronio, which I will tell you in detail shortly, the enchanting Renaissance palaces Communale and del Podestà are mentioned as the most important of these structures.<br/><br/>

                The construction process of Basilica di San Petronio, the sixth largest religious structure in Europe, started in 1390. However, for various reasons, the construction of the Gothic-style basilica is still unfinished.<br/><br/>
                Despite this situation, the religious structure manages to attract the majority of travelers who take a vacation in the city, thanks to its spiritual value and the valuable artifacts it contains.<br/><br/>
                When you visit the Basilica of San Petronio, in which there are more than twenty chapels dedicated to different saints, you can first head to the museum, which is full of drawings and models showing the stages of construction.<br/><br/>
                In the second hall of the museum, works of religious value are exhibited. After visiting the museum, which was opened in 1984, you can go to the terrace to enjoy the view. While the entrance to the basilica and the museum is free, €3 is requested from the visitors who want to go out to the terrace.<br/><br/>

                Basilica di Santo Stefano, which resembles a labyrinth; It is shown as the most beautiful religious building in Bologna with its architectural details specific to Romanesque, Lombardy and Ancient Rome.<br/><br/>
                In the area where the basilica, which is thought to have been built by St. Petronius in the 5th century, is located, there used to be a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis.<br/><br/>
                There were once seven different churches within the Basilica of Santo Stefano. However, of these religious buildings, only Chiesa del Crocefisso, Chiesa della Trinità, Chiesa del Santo Sepolcro and Santi Vitale e Agricola have survived to the present day.<br/><br/>

                The cultural facility, which welcomes its guests in Palazzo Galvani, which was built in the 15th century, was established in 1881. In the museum, which has become a frequent destination for travelers interested in history since then, I think that apart from the sections where the collections are exhibited, the private library may also be of interest to you.<br/><br/>
                As I mentioned at the beginning, the collection of the Bologna Archaeological Museum is focused on three great civilizations. However, if you spend time on the collections of Celtic and Greek civilizations besides Etruscan, Roman, Ancient Egypt, you will never regret it.<br/><br/>

                <br/><b>Cattedrale di San Pietro (Bologna Cathedral)</b><br/>
                You can also add Cattedrale di San Pietro to your list of places to visit in Bologna, as it almost resembles a museum.<br/><br/>
                The religious building, which made a name for itself with the decorations on its interior, was built in 1141 instead of the cathedral, which was on the same street and became unusable as a result of the fire.<br/><br/>
                The work in the 17th century had an impact on the building's current appearance.<br/><br/>
                When you enter the Bologna Cathedral, which is one of the places where travelers interested in art history show the most interest in the city, you can closely examine the masterful works of important artists such as Prospero Fontana, Ludovico Carracci and Donato Creti.<br/><br/>
                After spending time on these studies and the cathedral treasury, you can go up to the bell tower and watch the exquisite city view.<br/><br/>

                When you are looking for a special place to take photos, you can go to La Piccola Venezia, aka Little Venice, by passing under Porta Govese or Torresotto dei Piella.<br/><br/>
                Thus, you will have the opportunity to see the small canals that have been preserved since the beginning of the twentieth century, through the Venetian Window that awaits you in this peaceful corner of the city.<br/><br/>
                Opening to Canale delle Moline, an extension of Canale di Reno, the Venetian Window makes it possible to capture very special frames easily thanks to its location.<br/><br/>
                If you don't want to be content with the colorful image created by the houses surrounding the canal, you can also head to the windows around Via Oberdan and Via Malcontenti.<br/><br/>

                The foundations of the institute, which continues its educational activities under the name of Universita di Bologna, were laid towards the end of the 11th century.

                <br/><b>Ragù alla Bolognese ve Tagliatelle al Ragù</b><br/>
                Bologna, known as the gastronomic capital of Italy, is famous all over the world with the bolognese sauce it gives its name.<br/>
                So much so that when many people think of Bologna, the first thing that comes to mind is bolognese sauce. Think about it, in fact, the name of the city is mentioned every day, all over the world, thanks to this.<br/>
                However, I can't understand how the tourist eyes of the world are not fixed on it. I think it's a big mistake :)<br/>
                You'll probably be surprised to say this, but another mistake made by the rest of the world, apart from Italians, is to eat spaghetti with bolognese sauce. Let me tell you why...<br/><br/>
                Meat-based pasta sauces are quite common in Italian cuisine. These meat-based sauces, which consist of different recipes specific to different cities, are called ragù in general, and each sauce is associated with the city where it was born; Such as ragù alla Bolognese, ragù alla Napoletana, ragù alla Barese.<br/>
                Here is our famous bolognese sauce, ragù alla Bolognese itself. In its production, both red meat and pork are used; This sauce, which is obtained by boiling meat for hours with tomatoes, white wine and broth, is a suitable sauce for tagliatelle and lasagna.<br/>
                Italians never – I repeat NEVER – eat this sauce with spaghetti. The reason is that the sauce could not stand on the spaghetti and spilled on the plate while eating, in short, the sauce-pasta harmony could not be achieved.<br/>
                That's why they pair this sauce with tagliatelle, which is wider and flatter. Do not expect to see spaghetti bolognese on menus in Bologna; even the locals say that if you see a place where you see spaghetti bolognese on the menu, run away from there :) Instead, the keywords you will search in the menus should be tagliattelle al ragù.<br/><br/>

                <br/><b>Tortellini</b><br/>
                Another flavor that Bologna brought to the world is tortellini. Also known as the "belly hole of Venus" due to its shape, this fresh pasta has two main ingredients in its filling: pork and Parmigiano Reggiano, that is, parmesan cheese.<br/>
                Since the Emilia-Romagna region is rich in pork and is the homeland of Parmigiano Reggiano, it is not surprising that tortelli occupies a large place in the cuisines of Bologna and its neighbor Modena.<br/><br/>
                Those who do not eat pork and vegetarians should not be upset if we can't eat tortellini now. We're changing one letter: the keyword you search for in the menus is "tortelloni".<br/>
                Tortellini is usually stuffed with ricotta cheese and spinach. If you happen to be in Modena, you can also taste the pumpkin filled one.<br/><br/>
                In order to enjoy the filling of tortelli, Bologna people serve it like a soup in chicken broth instead of mixing it with sauce. This dish, known as “Tortellini in brodo”, is also the crown jewel of traditional Christmas tables.<br/>
                There is also the version of tortellini served with a buttery sage sauce, which I was amazed at when I ate it at a close friend's house years ago. It turns out that this type of service, which is included in the menu of many places with the name "tortellini (or vegetarian tortelloni) burro e salvia", was very popular in Bologna.<br/><br/>

                IGP stands for Indicazione Geografica Protetta, that is, geographical indication protection. When you see an IGP on the product label, know that the product was actually produced in that geographical region or country in accordance with the quality, description and characteristics appropriate to its geographical origin.<br/>
                In a sense, it is an abbreviation that helps you distinguish that similar products that do not have this mark have a different flavor or quality from the original product.<br/><br/>
                Bolognas serve mortadella in thin slices or cut into cubes. It is possible to try mortadella in many places, especially in the places in Quadrilatero.<br/><br/>
