                Barcelona, the capital of the Catalan Region in Spain, is frequented by thousands of tourists every year with its unique natural beauties, historical artifacts and architecture.<br/><br/>
                Barri Gòtic, the most mystical area of the city with its exciting streets, is one of the favorite destinations of travelers. Therefore, in our guide where to stay in Barcelona, the first place should be reserved for this region.<br/><br/>
                If you like fun, the Barri Gòtic area is for you. The streets of Barcelona's oldest and liveliest neighborhood are lined with Roman and medieval buildings, as well as numerous modern cafes, restaurants, bars, clubs and shops. The Gothic Quarter, which is part of the area, is also home to the Barcelona Cathedral, built between the 13th and 15th centuries.<br/><br/>
                The famous street La Rambla is located in the center of the Barri Gotic district. Here you can also see the world-famous La Boqueria Market, where authentic food and various spices are sold.<br/><br/>

                Suitable for those who want to stay close to the center, Barri Gòtic is an ideal choice especially for those who love nightlife.

                Sagrada Familia Basilica, one of the symbols of Barcelona and also on the UNESCO List, is shown as the greatest work of the famous architect Antoni Gaudi, who contributed to the popularity of the city.<br/><br/>
                In fact, for the construction of the basilica, the Religious Union of San Jose first agreed with Francisco de Paula de Villar y Lozano. However, when disagreements emerged between the two sides, the project was handed over to Gaudi in 1883 and he devoted his life to the building until 1926, when he died as a result of an accident.<br/><br/>
                Although the basilica was left unfinished after the death of the great master, it is considered as one of the must-see structures in Barcelona today.<br/><br/>
                If you also spare time for this flamboyant structure, you can take the sections of the Great Passion Gate, the Nativity Facade, the Burial Chamber, the Bell Towers, and the Spiral Stairs to the focal point of your tour.<br/><br/>
                Located in the northern part of Barcelona, with a capacity of 13 thousand people, the Sagrada Familia dominates the entire region with its 18 slender towers rising above all other monuments in the city. The work, which has been under construction for almost 140 years, is open to the public, although it is still under construction.<br/><br/>
                <u><i>Visiting Information:</i></u><br/><br/>

                Catalans usually wait after work to eat tapas. Considering that local people have a habit of eating dinner as late as 9:00 pm, this course of action does not seem unreasonable at all.<br/><br/>

                The dessert, which has been a veteran of Spanish cookbooks since the 14th century, resembles Crème Brûlée in terms of both appearance and consistency. Of course, I have to mention that this recipe is much older than its French counterpart.<br/><br/>
                Whole milk is the main ingredient of Crema Catalana. Cinnamon and lemon zest are added for flavor. Of course, don't be surprised if you see different forms of this dessert in food and beverage venues in the city.<br/><br/>
                Granja M. Viader is one of the most ideal places to eat Crema Catalana in Barcelona. Address: Carrer d'en Xuclà, 4-6, 08001<br/><br/>

                <br/><b>Churros</b><br/>
                Frankly, a bowl of Crema Catalana is mind-blowing. But for those who like pastries, Churros always means something different.<br/><br/>
                If my sentence above sounds too pretentious to you, I would like to point out that the dessert's fame went beyond Spain centuries ago and spread to the entire American continent.<br/><br/>
                This flavor, which resembles a ring dessert in form, is served without syrup. But thanks to the chocolate sauce served with it, there is no need for such a touch. However, this sauce can also be offered for consumption by pouring it directly on the freshly fried pastry in some patisseries.<br/><br/>
                If you intend to pamper yourself with a crispy portion of Churros, you can add the following two places to your list of places to visit in Barcelona.<br/><br/>
                Granja La Pallaresa: Carrer de Petritxol, 11, 08002<br/>
                La Nena: Carrer de Ramón y Cajal, 36, 08012<br/>
