                <br/>Yes, our subject is three episodes, you will be afraid when you talk about these English series, friend. Didn't they even bring the 100-year-old sherlock holmes into our eyes with three-episode series like that? I never, ever expected it to be this impressive. It's an amazing series with a different über creative scenario in each episode. A 3-season masterpiece that tells the possible human psychology and human relations in a striking way, without going into the science-fiction part of the event, even in the sections where ultra-technological events are mentioned. Just a technological foresight for the future is not enough to write such a series. The main thing that distinguishes Black Mirror from other fairy-tale sci-fi movies is that it includes sociological and social information. people's ability to show their inherent competitiveness, individualism. In the 2nd episode of the 1st season, our black friend expressed the absurdity of life, his tiredness arising from people blindly believing this nonsense, but even this realistic expression was able to use the system to its advantage and the man's "sincere" speech was a tool for his own "artificial". He had it and used it for his own benefit. Isn't it like that in real life too? Men who have officially pointed to one of the most important problems in my mind about the hopelessness of life. The fact that today's journalists shift the troubles in the world to a different direction because they also serve the mistakes in the system (cnn programmers, announcers, journalists, and the mainstream media in general), the capitalist thought, which is the main cause of wars in the world, hunger, poverty and even they can't even talk about the real reason for the rapes (this issue is the devaluation of people who have been pushed to inadequacy and not being respected by the society in general, and the fact that they affect each other in those environments). they serve the darkness as intellectuals. I saw it in this episode too. It shows that the main reason for being against self-interest is to target self-interested people for their own benefit, rather than being a moralistic, righteous type of person. The 3rd part was a completely different part, it was again a very nice part where individual analysis and future interpretation were blended. He showed how much a person can lie in a realistic way, without ever getting caught up in romance and without artificial human movements. It is a series that I find to be a very overdose post-modern that pushes the limits of a very beautiful person's brain. it creates a metallic consciousness perception in my mind after watching it officially. Without exception, all disciplines such as mechanics/electronics/mechatronics/genetics have been designed flawlessly, human beings, no matter how much they develop technology, suddenly return to their primitive form when it comes to instincts, that what evolves is knowledge and technology based on this knowledge, and that human beings have not actually evolved much, It's the most futuristic and most successful TV series I've watched recently, which tells people by presenting them with a different perspective.. watch and have them watch 10 out of 10<br/>
